# Radar-Jamming
To Develop Operational Flight Program Control Logic for Radar Jamming . We used C/C++ for write source code , Operating system for create Multi threading , DSA for Optimise and make efficient the code . We made this project to optimised and 40% faster than previous.
# PROBLEM 
A pilot is flying a aircraft and suddenly see there are some unknown radar is trying to approach aircraft and pilot is scared suddenly then pilot have to decide to share imformation or misguide them. 
# APPROACH
• This program generates a random list with n elements each having different weightage.\\
• Elements here represent four different radar jamming techniques (T1, T2, T3 and T4). \\
• Program stores the randomized order of these techniques in an array. Each technique has certain number of RFTG.\\
• When any technique out of T1, T2, T3 and T4 is allocated it will run for fixed duration of time, x ms.\\
• If the RFTG is available, it will be moved from free to allocated list. \\
• If the corresponding RFTG is unavailable, program prints “resource unavailable”.
